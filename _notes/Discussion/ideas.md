## Project Ideas 
- A hybrid of wiki and newspaper. A feed will contain newspaper editions, inside those newspapers there will be links to other newspaper stories or 'hidden' stuff. Hidden stuff might be internal memos from organizations, essays, letters, etc. It should all have some kind of diagetic justification of how this document came to be. Links are non-diagetic though, so there could be a link in document A to doc B even though the author of A would have no way of knowing about B. So the newspaper will serve as a portal into the world.

## World Ideas
- Growing influence of cult w/ highly specific vocabulary.
- DARPA-type agency / lab
