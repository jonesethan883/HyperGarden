I was talking to a friend recently about what could substitute me. Like I get information from a certain collection of sources, I interpret it in a certain way, and then I say things based on what I hear. But most of what I have to say that's somewhat valuable to other people has already been said, whether in the stuff that I read or by someone else who's read it. And while the exact way I turn the things I learn into ideas is idiosyncratic, is it *that* idiosyncratic? If there are differences that make what I have to say unique, are the differences important?

So why reinvent the wheel? If a given paragraph I write has already been written in a better way by someone expressing the same idea, why not just copy over their paragraph with attribution?

This sort of idea was popular in the early computer networking community. There was a convergence with the kind of highly interdisciplinary super-generalized philosophy of information being done at the time, stuff like cybernetics and structuralist linguistics[[Cf. the work of people like [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush), [Stafford Beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer), [Alfred Korzybski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_semantics)::rsn]] promising to transform the nature of knowledge. [Project Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu), an [infamous](https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/) early contendor to the World Wide Web, believed that documents could work through a visible network of direct [transclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion) and citation.

Intellectual work would be as much collating parts of things and connecting them as directly producing something new. It was impractical for a lot of reasons and most of those idealistic mid century projects hoping to rationalize or revolutionize human thought were overambitious failures. But I think about it a lot because I deeply sympathize with the problem I feel like they were trying to solve. The intellectual busywork.

The promise of the internet and computer knowledge systems was to alleviate the huge amounts of redundancy and time wasting that happens in thought work. In a way this has absolutely come true, the amount of time that might've been spent looking through dictionaries or libraries trying to filter out one tiny piece of information which has now been saved is really staggering. But it still feels like there's more that could be done. The work currently being automated is annoyances, papercuts. But the actual meat of writing doesn't seem that different on a computer than it must've on a typewriter[[As evidenced by the many writers who still use typewriters, and the number of writing apps which have something like a "zen mode" or "typewriter mode"::lsn]]. The internet seems like a bigger technological leap than the printing press[[It's a cliche, but the number of books in continental europe went from being counted in [thousands to millions](https://www.britannica.com/topic/publishing/The-age-of-early-printing-1450-1550) in just 50 years.::rsn]], but the changes to the way we create ideas feels smaller[[The changes to the way we *disseminate* information, as opposed to creating it, do seem much larger though.::rmn]]. One of the things that the project Xanadu creators [decry](https://www.xanadu.net/XanaduSpace/btf.htm) is the way that webpages are most often designed to imitate paper rather than take advantage of the technology with [completely new forms](https://maggieappleton.com/spatial-web). 

And it's this unrealized potential that I find annoying. I want a computer that can truly organize information, so that if I'm talking to someone I can link them to a thought or concept in my own head as easily as linking them to a webpage. And so that the way that I understand that concept- the collection of books, movies, other conversations that led back to it, is clearly visible to them. The friction comes from the unnecessary gap between the ways that computers organize information and the ways that humans want to interact with it.

And on the opposite side I hate the redundancy. There's a cliche about recipe websites, that they tend to have a bunch of annoying filler where the author will write a long personal blog post before the actual recipe part. I see this as just one part of a general phenomenon. This recipe is full of filler, but go back to the results page for the search. How many different websites are there with a page describing the recipe? How many recipes are there in general? Google gives about 208 different sites for "Chocolate chip cookie recipe", although that's only a small fraction of what's actually out there. Allrecipes alone has 6,000 results. Of course this makes sense at some level. There's a lot of complexity to a cookie. Different variations exist for different tastes, skill levels of cooks, dietary restrictions, and experimenting with new ingredients. But I don't think that's a sufficient explanation. Even with this variety a lot of the recipes are plainly redundant and the work that went into creating them is also redundant to some degree. There's a lot of raw information there, but it's not accessible. I can't go through all these recipes trying to figure out what makes them different, what ideas to take from each in order to suit my needs. There's effort being spent on the creation of better cookie recipes but it's not organized effort. The work of collating the information is an important step so that the person looking for a recipe is able to find *one* recipe that suits *their* needs, drawing from the best possible information, and placed right in front of them [[Google's [knowledge panels](https://support.google.com/knowledgepanel/answer/9163198?hl=en) are an attempt to do this, but their success is always going to be limited by the way we actually organize our knowledge. Wikipedia does a better job but it can only cover a limited range of topics and can't adapt to the reader's background.::rsn]]

There are real downsides to this approach though. The super scalable nature of content on the web makes it subject to a [winner take all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winner-take-all_market) effect. How is your friend's cookie recipe ever going to compete with the Xanadunet's hyper optimized maximally satisfying cookie formula achieved through years of ruthless competition in the distributed cookie knowledge network? I don't think it's possible to have universal correctness without ending up creating a de facto homogeneity. People will value their ability to contribute to and control parts of the world independently of the actual value of those parts.
