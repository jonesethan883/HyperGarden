I want to complain about textbook design. As a disclosure I don't have any special knowledge or qualification in pedagogy or design, so grain of salt.

Essentially I think that textbooks are overstructured. They use many different design and organization elements to achieve many different goals, and end up overloading the text and making it difficult to read in a linear way.

Non-linear organization might not seem like a downside at first. If anything it sounds great, revolutionary, downright *2.0*. You can imagine some visionary giving you a pitch: "Human knowledge isn't linear, so why are our textbooks? We need to enable hyperlinked multi-depth interactive customizable knowledge that understands and adapts to the individual learner." And I don't even disagree! I want all those things, but there are caveats.

## Linearity and Scale

There's a common pitch that I've heard applied to things like [mind maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map), [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), [personal wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki), and ther projects that question the way we structure information. They generally come with a graph like this.

and a bit of copy implying that this method is more in line with how humans naturally think. This is true, but only at a certain scale. To me it seems like a fact needs to be situated in a large enough linear narrative flow to actually be readable, and only after it's read and understood do you start to connect it to other things like in the graph.

My problem with texbtooks is that I think their linear flows are too short. Bad textbooks constantly disrupt their exposition with what I'll call "Widgets"[[Because of their visual resemblance to software widgets. They might already have a name I don't know::rsn]]. Widgets are most commonly pictures and examples, but they can also be tables, quotes, lists, questions, vocabulary lists, and a variety of slightly more marketingese names like Learning Outcomes, Knowledge Breakouts, Key Takeaways, Investigation Questions, Reflection Exercises, Real World Applications, etc.

Some of these widgets are useful; active learning and reflective reading are genuinely proven techniques[[Although interestingly they often don't *feel* as useful as they are. There was a study comparing a traditional lecture format to an active learning lecture which found that the students rated their comprehension and enjoyment lower for the active learning, but performed better on a test of what they learned::lsn]]. Examples and lists are absolutely necessary for comprehension. Others are more ambiguous. If anyone has ever gotten anything valuable out of scanning a QR code in a textbok, logging in to the publisher's website, and playing a cheap animation or interactive I encourage them to write in:

But I think all widgets, good or bad, are disruptive. They take you out of a context and into another
