Blogs, articles and videos on the internet that I find interesting. I try to filter this to stuff that's ‘Evergreen’. I.e. it should be enjoyable for most people without special background or context.

## Newsletters / Blogs
Things I think are worth subscribing to generally.

- Matt Levine's *[Money Stuff](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine)* - Interesting and funny stories about finance explained in a simple way that doesn't assume a finance background. Gives a lot of context to the financial theory behind news events.
- Ryan Broderick's *[Garbage Day](https://www.garbageday.email)* - A newsletter about the internet. A mix of stories about things that happened on the internet and analysis of internet culture which is done in a more thoughtful way than usual.
- Max Read's *[Read Max](https://maxread.substack.com)* - Similar to Garbage Day but with a more general focus. Content can be all over the place but is generally interesting to read
- Bret Deveraux's *[A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry](https://acoup.blog)* - A blog about history. Mainly talks about political and military history with a mix between specific events and broader concepts, sometimes explained using pop-culture examples. I would recommend [this series](https://acoup.blog/2021/06/11/collections-the-queens-latin-or-who-were-the-romans-part-i-beginnings-and-legends/) of posts about how Romans conceived of Roman identity to get a feel for it.

## Articles
### [Buckle Up Twitter is Cancelled](https://theoutline.com/post/7295/buckle-up-twitter-is-cancelled)
A fun to read criticism of "Buckle Up Twitter", a genre of simplistic historical 'explainer' threads with an affectedly down to earth tone.

>Buckle Up Twitter threads tend to proceed from two assumptions. The first is that no one but the author of the thread has ever read a book, and the second is that no one actually ever needs to read a book in order to understand anything, because what do you need a motherfucking BOOK for when you have ALL THE INFORMATION YOU COULD POSSIBLY NEED RIGHT HERE IN THIS GODDAMN BITCH OF A THREAD. There’s not a whole lot of daylight between that and the insistence that, I don’t know, _no one in the history of the world has ever had any reason or desire to read Ulysses_.

### [The Fiddle Leaf Fig Is Dead](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/16/style/fiddle-leaf-fig-plants.html) - \$
A description of the industry of finding and cultivating new houseplants, and the concept of fashion and trends within houseplants. 

>Mike Rimland, the “plant hunter” for Costa Farms, one of the largest houseplant growers in North America, was touring a tiny nursery in Southeast Asia about five years ago when he spotted a bunch of dark purple waxy leaves he didn’t recognize.
>[...]
>Now, after years of development, the Geo has arrived at stores and recently won the coveted honor of “Best New Foliage” at the Tropical Plant International Expo, a top industry trade show. It is on sale at major retailers and small boutiques as far and wide as Brooklyn, Los Angeles and Des Moines

### [Frank Sinatra Has a Cold](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a638/frank-sinatra-has-a-cold-gay-talese/)
"The defining piece of journalism about Frank Sinatra, and one of the most celebrated magazine stories ever published." One of the classics of the [New Journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Journalism) style.
>Frank Sinatra, holding a glass of bourbon in one hand and a cigarette in the other, stood in a dark corner of the bar between two attractive but fading blondes who sat waiting for him to say something. But he said nothing; he had been silent during much of the evening, except now in this private club in Beverly Hills he seemed even more distant, staring out through the smoke and semidarkness into a large room beyond the bar where dozens of young couples sat huddled around small tables or twisted in the center of the floor to the clamorous clang of folk-rock music blaring from the stereo. The two blondes knew, as did Sinatra's four male friends who stood nearby, that it was a bad idea to force conversation upon him when he was in this mood of sullen silence, a mood that had hardly been uncommon during this first week of November, a month before his fiftieth birthday.

A contest to write the funniest first sentence of a bad novel. Running anually for the past 20 years.
>Does the dance of love have to be a dairy of romantic sonnets; can it not be a Haiku and still be sensually poetic? 
>-*Sue Randolph*

> Her face, though scalded, was as lily-white as I could ever want as we jovially kissed.
> -Lucas Keppel

> The men greeted each other, wearing various smiles on their faces.
> -Noah MacAulay
