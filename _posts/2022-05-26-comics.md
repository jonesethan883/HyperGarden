Comics are made by tracing stock photos. If you are a photographer whose work was used to make a comic and you'd like it taken down please submit an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/jonesethan883/jonesethan883.github.io). Comics may contain violence, sexual content, depictions of abuse, and explicit language including slurs.
